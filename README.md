# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes 31 features: 28 anonymized features (from PCA), the transaction `Amount`, and the `Class` label (0 for valid, 1 for fraud).

Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
